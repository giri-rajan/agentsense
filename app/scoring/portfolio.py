"""
Portfolio scoring — rank a backlog of workflows by agentification readiness.

This turns AgentSense from a single-workflow advisor into a transformation
portfolio planner: feed it several candidate workflows and it ranks where agents
deliver the most value first. Every score here is COMPUTED by the same 12-criteria
engine used in the main flow — none are hard-coded.
